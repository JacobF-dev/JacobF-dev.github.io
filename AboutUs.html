    <h1>A Bit About Us</h1>

    <img src="Group.jpg" id="productimg" align="right">

    <p class="info">We are a small group, based in SJP II Academy, who is selling handcrafted reindeer Christmas ornaments as a way to fundraise for a charity called World Central Kitchen (https://wck.org/). From left to right, out names are Kelvin, Christophe and Jacob. We are all glad you took the time to visit our website. Kelvin has helped us out throughout the project, completing many paragraphs and sub-projects that allowed us progress and develop our product. Christophe is the financial manager and head of our business. He developed our product and managed everyone so we could meet the time requirements. Jacob is our website developer and marketing manager. He designed the entire website and order form, as well as negotiated projects with other teams to help you get the best deals out of our products.</p>
