    <p class="charitytext">The charity we would like to support is the World Central Kitchen. The World Central Kitchen is a charity that specializes in feeding unfortunate people who have gone through natural disasters, are homeless, or poor throughout the entire world. So far they have delivered, in total, about 33,433,000 meals. The reason we want to support it is because we all know that food is a vital part of a person's development as a child, and their wellbeing throughout their entire lives. We think that this charity embodies Christian values because helping the unfortunate is a very prominent theme throughout the Bible.</p>
