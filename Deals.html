    <p class="info">Our team has created several bundles and deals just for you. Our first deal is a value pack. For every two ornaments you buy, the next one will be 50% off! That’s a great deal for those who want amazing ornaments hung on their tree for a cheap cost! <br> Our second deal is a collaboration with another group. We will be working with team Sabastian and Sofia for the duration of this project. This bundle is designed specifically for parents that not only want one of our fabulous ornaments, but also a few sweets for the Christmas season. This bundle includes one ornament and one bag of sweets for the cost of only $5.50! That’s 50 cents cheaper than paying full price for both of these items!</p>
